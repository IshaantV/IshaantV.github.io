theta_fetcher.py

theta_fetcher.py requires that you have an account registered with thetadata for the javascript to retrieve the data from their servers and produce a graph, sometimes the graph plotting works and sometimes it doesn't, I'm currently looking into this right now.

MonteCarloSim_Weather.py

The code uses pre-existing data values to create graphs through deterministic models, to create a predicted temperature curve, however in a week i will be able to code a monte carlo simulation into it, making the prediction more realistic and reliable.
